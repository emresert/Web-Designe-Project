        was upset. What is more, he was not even talking to us. Should we have told him that we had not forgotten his birthday?
        No… No… No… Then, it would not be a surprise part for him. First, I got him a birthday cake. And then, the class prepared
        a video. Everyone on the video was celebrating his birthday. I remember the video was so beautiful. We started to wait
        in the class. The video was ready. The birthday cake was ready. We lighted the candles of the cake. We were all waiting.
        The whole class was looking at the door. The door opened but it was not my friend. It was our teacher. I was so surprised
        because I was waiting for my friend to come. My friends were laughing at me, this is because I was so excited. At that
        time, my friend entered into the class. He was very happy. I was very happy, too. In conclusion, sometimes, people can
        be happy with little things. Be happy…It was my friend’s birthday and I was smiling because my friend thought we had
